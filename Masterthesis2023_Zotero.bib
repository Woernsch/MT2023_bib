  abstract = {The assessment of Enterprise Governance of IT (EGIT) frameworks and standards such as COBIT 5 and ISO 27001, when adopted simultaneously, implies an unreasonable effort because each framework and standard defines its own scope, definitions, and terminologies. Using these frameworks and standards independently prevents organizations from achieving the full benefits of EGIT since there are limitations on their application to specific Information Technology (IT) areas. Also, as these frameworks and standards overlap, at a time when organizations strive to be efficient and effective, it seems counterintuitive to be wasting resources by having different organizational departments handling both approaches independently. Thus, the primary goal of this paper is to facilitate the COBIT 5 and ISO 27001 simultaneous assessment. To reach this goal, an Enterprise Architecture (EA) metamodel representation of ISO 27001 and its mapping to COBIT 5 is proposed using ArchiMate as the EA modeling language. The ISO 27001 metamodel is also extended with ISO/IEC Technical Specification (TS) 33052 and ISO/IEC TS 33072 because these standards propose a Process Reference Model and a Process Assessment Model for Information Security management, which are essential models to assess ISO 27001 and COBIT 5 simultaneously. A field study was conducted in the Portuguese Navy regarding the COBIT 5 Manage Service Requests and Incidents process and its corresponding controls in ISO 27001 through the mapped ISO/ IEC TS 33052 processes.},

  abstract = {Scalability is a desirable attribute of a network, system, or process. Poor scalability can result in poor system performance, necessitating the reengineering or duplication of systems. While scalability is valued, its characteristics and the characteristics that undermine it are usually only apparent from the context. Here, we attempt to define different aspects of scalability, such as structural scalability and load scalability. Structural scalability is the ability of a system to expand in a chosen dimension without major modifications to its architecture. Load scalability is the ability of a system to perform gracefully as the offered traffic increases. It is argued that systems with poor load scalability may exhibit it because they repeatedly engage in wasteful activity, because they are encumbered with poor scheduling algorithms, because they cannot fully take advantage of parallelism, or because they are algorithmically inefficient. We qualitatively illustrate these concepts with classical examples from the literature of operating systems and local area networks, as well as an example of our own. Some of these are accompanied by rudimentary delay analysis.},

Most subjective measures used in practice are unvalidated, and their relationship to system usage is unknown. The present research develops and validates new scales for two specific variables, perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are hypothesized to be fundamental determinants of user acceptance. Definitionsfor these two variables were used to develop scale items thatwerepretested forcontent validityand then tested forreliability and construct validityin two studies involving a total of 152 users and four applicationprograms. Themeasures were refinedand streamlined, resultingin two six-itemscales withreliabilities of .98 for usefulness and .94 for ease of use. The scales exhibited high convergent, discriminanta,nd factoriavl alidityP. erceivedusefulnesswas significantlycorrelatedwithbothselfreported current usage (r=.63, Study 1) and self-predictedfutureusage (r=.85, Study2). Perceived ease of use was also significantlycorrelated withcurrentusage (r=.45, Study 1) and futureusage (r=.59, Study 2). In both studies, usefulness had a significantlygreater correlation withusage behaviorthan did ease of use. Regression analyses suggest that perceived ease of use may actually be a causal antecedent to perceived usefulness, as opposed to a parallel,direct determinantof system usage. Implicationsare drawn for futureresearch on user acceptance.},

  abstract = {The effectiveness of a Design Science Research (DSR) project is judged both by the fitness of the designed artifact as a solution in the application environment and by the level of new research contributions. An important and understudied challenge is how to translate DSR project research goals into discrete and measurable evaluation criteria for use in the DSR processes. This position paper proposes an inclusive approach for articulating DSR goals and then identifying project evaluation criteria for these goals. The goals are organized hierarchically as utilitarian goals, safety goals, interaction and communication goals, cognitive and aesthetic goals, innovation goals, and evolution goals. Goals in a DSR project are identified pragmatically by considering the components of the context coupled with the hierarchy of goals. Based on the identified goals, the associated evaluation criteria are determined and organized along the same hierarchy. These criteria measure the ability of the artifact to meet its goals in its context (immediate fitness). Moreover, our approach also supports the innovation and research contributions of the project. The apex of the goal hierarchy addresses the identification of criteria measuring the fitness for evolution of the designed artifact, to accommodate for changes in goals or context.},

  abstract = {The World Wide Web (WWW) or the Web has been recognized as a powerful new information exchange channel in recent years. Today, an ever-increasing number of businesses have set up Web sites to publicize their products and services. However, careful planning and preparation is needed to achieve the intended purpose of this new information exchange channel. This paper proposes a comprehensive framework for effective commercial Web application development based on prior research in hypermedia and human-computer interfaces. The framework regards Web application development as a special type of software development project. At the onset of the project, its social acceptability is investigated. Next, economic, technical, operational, and organizational viability are examined. For Web page design, both the functionality and usability of Web pages are thoroughly considered. The use of the framework should result in more effective commercial Web application development.},

  abstract = {Artifacts, such as software systems, pervade organizations and society. In the field of information systems (IS) they form the core of research. The evaluation of IS artifacts thus represents a major issue. Although IS research paradigms are increasingly intertwined, building and evaluating artifacts has traditionally been the purview of design science research (DSR). DSR in IS has not reached maturity yet. This is particularly true of artifact evaluation. This paper investigates the ``what'' and the ``how'' of IS artifact evaluation: what are the objects and criteria of evaluation, the methods for evaluating the criteria, and the relationships between the ``what'' and the ``how'' of evaluation? To answer these questions, we develop a taxonomy of evaluation methods for IS artifacts. With this taxonomy, we analyze IS artifact evaluation practice, as reflected by ten years of DSR publications in the basket of journals of the Association for Information Systems (AIS). This research brings to light important relationships between the dimensions of IS artifact evaluation, and identifies seven typical evaluation patterns: demonstration; simulation- and metricbased benchmarking of artifacts; practice-based evaluation of effectiveness; simulation- and metric-based absolute evaluation of artifacts; practice-based evaluation of usefulness or ease of use; laboratory, student-based evaluation of usefulness; and algorithmic complexity analysis. This study also reveals a focus of artifact evaluation practice on a few criteria. Beyond immediate usefulness, IS researchers are urged to investigate ways of evaluating the long-term organizational impact and the societal impact of artifacts.},

  abstract = {Seminal works in the application of design science research (DSR) in IS emphasize the importance of evaluation. However, discussion of evaluation activities and methods is limited and typically assumes an ex post perspective, in which evaluation occurs after the construction of an IS artifact. Such perspectives can assume that the evaluation is an empirical process and its methods can be selected in the same way as empirical research methods. In this paper, we analyze a broader range of evaluation strategies, which includes ex ante (prior to artifact construction) evaluation. This broader view is developed as a strategic DSR evaluation framework, which expands evaluation choices for IS DSR researchers, and also adds emphasis to strategies for evaluating design processes in addition to design products, using well-known quality criteria as an important asset. The framework encompasses both ex ante and ex post orientations as well as naturalistic settings (e.g., case studies) and artificial settings (e.g., lab experiments) for DSR evaluation. The framework proposed offers a strategic view of DSR evaluation that is useful in analyzing published studies, and also in surfacing the evaluation opportunities that present themselves to IS DSR researchers.},

  abstract = {Evaluation is a central and essential activity in conducting rigorous Design Science Research (DSR), yet there is surprisingly little guidance about designing the DSR evaluation activity beyond suggesting possible methods that could be used for evaluation. This paper extends the notable exception of the existing framework of Pries-Heje et al [11] to address this problem. The paper proposes an extended DSR evaluation framework together with a DSR evaluation design method that can guide DSR researchers in choosing an appropriate strategy for evaluation of the design artifacts and design theories that form the output from DSR. The extended DSR evaluation framework asks the DSR researcher to consider (as input to the choice of the DSR evaluation strategy) contextual factors of goals, conditions, and constraints on the DSR evaluation, e.g. the type and level of desired rigor, the type of artifact, the need to support formative development of the designed artifacts, the properties of the artifact to be evaluated, and the constraints on resources available, such as time, labor, facilities, expertise, and access to research subjects. The framework and method support matching these in the first instance to one or more DSR evaluation strategies, including the choice of ex ante (prior to artifact construction) versus ex post evaluation (after artifact construction) and naturalistic (e.g., field setting) versus artificial evaluation (e.g., laboratory setting). Based on the recommended evaluation strategy(ies), guidance is provided concerning what methodologies might be appropriate within the chosen strategy(ies).},

From every indication it is likely to be more than a passing fad and the changes these emerging digital services represent will continue to transform commerce and have yet to reach market saturation. Digital services are being designed for and offered to users, yet very little is known about the design process that goes behind these developments. Is there a science behind designing digital services? By examining 12 leading digital services, we have developed a design taxonomy to be able to classify and contrast digital services. What emerged in the taxonomy were two broad dimensions; a set of fundamental design objectives and a set of fundamental service provider objectives. This paper concludes with an application of the proposed taxonomy to three leading digital services. We hope that the proposed taxonomy will be useful in understanding the science behind the design of digital services.},
